# plus-minus-zero

An EMA rank points calculator. Temporary manually-updated demo [hosted on my blog](http://m50d.github.io/ema)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/m50d/plus-minus-zero.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/m50d/plus-minus-zero)

## TODO

 * Release to maven central / webjars CDN and have the demo source the javascript from there
 * Integrate CSS with Scala code rather than just using class attributes
 * Calculate per-tournament points from position and number of entrants
 * Temporal results (i.e. automatic application of MERS weight decay)
 * Fetch current player stats in a more robust way (ideally an EMA API)
 * Ensure the project is easy for other people to host in a license-compliant way
